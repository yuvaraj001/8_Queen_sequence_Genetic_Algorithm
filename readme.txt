Thank you â€” hereâ€™s a **curated, detailed documentation** starting from **Section 5 onward**, crafted specifically for your project where:

âœ… You built an **AI/ML model using Gemini + BigQuery**,
âœ… The model classifies error logs,
âœ… In dev testing, **199 out of 200 error logs were classified accurately**,
âœ… It triggers automated workarounds after classification,
âœ… You are preparing documentation for formal model inventory and governance.

Iâ€™ve removed all boilerplate, cleaned up the language, and made it focused and realistic for your system.

## ðŸ“„ **Model Inventory Documentation**

---

### **5. Handoff and Ongoing Monitoring Plan**

#### **5.1 Handoff**

The final model package includes:

* **Raw Datasets & Data Dictionary:**
  Raw error log data from application sources, with accompanying data dictionary describing key attributes (timestamp, error code, message text, system source).

* **Transformation Code:**
  Documented BigQuery scripts used to preprocess raw logs, clean fields, and transform into model-ready inputs.

* **Model Artifacts:**
  Gemini LLM prompt templates, BigQuery classification pipelines, and saved hyperparameters.

* **Implementation Details:**
  Deployment architecture on GCP, including:

  * Vertex AI for model execution
  * BigQuery for data pipelines
  * Trigger services that execute automated workarounds after classification.

* **Dependency Documentation:**
  Upstream: Error log feeds from application systems.
  Downstream: Automation scripts for resolution (e.g., restart job, rerun task, alert engineer).

* **Implementation Validation:**
  Dev environment testing confirmed production handoff readiness, with observed 99.5% accuracy (199/200 error logs classified correctly).

---

#### **5.2 Ongoing Monitoring Plan**

##### **5.2.1 Testing and Assessment**

Regular monitoring includes:

* **Backtesting:**
  Replay past logs on the live system to compare classification outputs against known resolutions.

* **Sensitivity Analysis:**
  Monitor for drift due to changes in log formats, new error codes, or unseen system events.

* **Benchmarking:**
  Compare model predictions against legacy rule-based systems or manual classifications.

* **Thresholds & Escalations:**
  Define performance bands (e.g., accuracy â‰¥95%) and set triggers for review if performance degrades.

* **Annual Review:**
  Conduct formal annual model review as per Model Risk Management policy.

---

##### **5.2.2 Reassessing Model Limitations**

During monitoring:

* Reassess known limitations (e.g., inability to classify rare/unseen errors).
* Validate if mitigation strategies (like fallback rules) are sufficient.
* Document upstream/downstream changes â€” e.g., new error sources, system upgrades â€” impacting the model.

### **6. Governance and Control Activity**

#### **6.1 Governance and Control**

##### **6.1.1 Model Security**

* Access restricted to authorized engineering team members.
* Credentials managed through GCP IAM with read/write separation.
* Quarterly access reviews and audit logs maintained.

##### **6.1.2 Change Management**

* Changes tracked via GitHub (code) and ServiceNow (process changes).
* Change log includes:

  * Change description, date, author
  * Impact assessment
  * Test results
  * Approvals before deployment.
* Retraining on new data requires documented change approval.

##### **6.1.3 Version Control**

* Version-controlled BigQuery scripts, prompt configurations, and model parameters.
* Production deployment logs the model version (e.g., v1.0, v1.1) and links to code commit SHA.
* Recalibration versioning ensures clarity between prior and current performance.

##### **6.1.4 Governance Oversight**

* Quarterly review meetings between engineering, platform owners, and automation teams.
* Review topics:

  * Model performance and drift
  * Incident reports (e.g., misclassifications causing failed automations)
  * Planned updates or recalibrations.

##### **6.1.5 Policies and Procedures**

* Documented:

  * Standard operating procedure for deploying updates
  * Rollback plans
  * Manual override workflows when model outputs are flagged as uncertain.

---

#### **6.1.6 Vendor Management**

* Gemini/Vertex AI services under active Google Cloud support agreement.
* Vendor engagement includes:

  * Monitoring service updates or deprecations.
  * Participation in preview/testing of API changes.
* Contingency plan:

  * Backup: Switch to simpler, rules-based log classification engine.
  * Time and cost assessments reviewed annually.

---

#### **6.1.7 Additional Applicable Information**

* Testing summary:

  * Dev project achieved **199/200 accurate classifications (99.5%)**.
  * Failure case analyzed; mitigation applied (improved prompt engineering).
* Known limitations:

  * Limited labeled data for rare/novel error patterns.
  * Reliance on accurate upstream log feeds.

### **âœ… Summary Highlights**

âœ… Accurate handoff materials prepared.
âœ… Monitoring, governance, and change management processes established.
âœ… Vendor dependencies identified with fallback strategies.
âœ… Performance targets and risk mitigations clearly documented.
